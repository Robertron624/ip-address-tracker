## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Saas](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- [Ipify API](https://geo.ipify.org/) - for IP address data
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - for map
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - for API calls

### What I learned

With this project I learned how to create a custom hook for reusable API calls, I also learned how to use the leaflet library for maps and how to use the ipify API to get the IP address data.

custom hook for API calls:
```js
export const UseIp = <T,>(ip: string) => {
    const [data, setData] = useState<T | null>(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);
    const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchData = async () => {
            setLoading(true);
            try {
                const response = await axios.get(ip);
                setData(response.data);
            } catch (error:any) {
                setError(error.message);
            }
            setLoading(false);
        };
        fetchData();
    }, [ip])

    return { data, loading, error };
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [React Reusable API Calls With Custom Hooks](https://betterprogramming.pub/react-reusable-api-calls-with-custom-hooks-typescript-obviously-a62fda7df1b6) - This helped me to create an easier way to make API calls in React. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
